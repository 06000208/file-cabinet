# [file cabinet](https://github.com/06000208/file-cabinet) / motds

Just a lot of motds in a txt file. Motd length and humor varies, most are references, puns, or nonsense.

Useful if you're running a game server like minecraft or team fortress 2 and want to randomize part of "the message of the day", per day.

This concept works better the more motds there are, so feel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/06000208/motds/issues) or pull request and suggest as many as you'd like.
